# Library Experience and Resume

I had originally intended this final project to be a photo album for the time I spent in Copenhagen last Christmas. I changed my mind about half way through the quarter and decided instead to make a resume style website where I could share my library experience. I wanted to show all of the cool things and hard work I've put into the last few years so I can advocate for a promotion.
